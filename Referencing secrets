2.1.  Referencing secrets
Since we will be able to use this file as we do the regular config files we are also able to reference the secrets in a similar way.

You will need to import the OS functions and then call the secret names.

code snippet:

import os

variable = os.getenv("secret")

* NOTE:  make sure lines in code are referencing the secret name from our secrets file in the prereqs folder.
